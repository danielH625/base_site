        <p><strong>Base 2</strong>, commonly referred to as binary, is the foundational encoding system used in computing and digital systems. It consists of only two digits: 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>Each digit in Base 2 is called a <em>bit</em>. By combining bits, we can represent all forms of data, from simple text to complex multimedia files.</p>
        <h2>Applications of Base 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All modern computer systems operate on binary logic.</li>
            <li>Binary encoding is used in network protocols and data transmission.</li>
            <li>Encryption systems often start with binary representation before further transformations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        <p>Binary encoding was first introduced in the context of mathematics by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century. It later became a cornerstone of computer science.</p>
